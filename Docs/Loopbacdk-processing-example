### Domain Configuration 
#### Organizational units 
The Domain has two different organizational units (OU) $\color{green}{\textsf{Green}}$ and $\color{red}{\textsf{Red}}$.  
- $\color{green}{\textsf{Green}}$ OU contains a Computer account
- $\color{red}{\textsf{Red}}$ OU contains User account

#### Policies
The $\color{green}{\textsf{Green}}$ policy, which has settings “$\color{green}{\textsf{Computer Configuration 2}}$” and “$\color{green}{\textsf{User Configuration 2}}$” is applied to the OU with the computer account. 

The $\color{red}{\textsf{Red}}$ policy, which has settings “$\color{red}{\textsf{Computer Configuration 1}}$” and “$\color{red}{\textsf{User Configuration 1}}$”, is applied to the OU with the User account. If you have a look at the picture below it will become clearer.
